## Project Description

This project aims to develop an automated insurance pricing system using GLMs.
It covers data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The goal is to create a robust and interpretable model that can accurately
predict insurance claim frequencies or severities, enabling efficient and
fair premium calculations.
